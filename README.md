# Types of Software: Application, System, Open-Source, Proprietary, Programming, and Malicious  

This document is part of my **Software Engineering Fundamentals certification at Platzi**.  
It summarizes the main types of software, their uses, and their impact both in everyday life and in the field of cybersecurity.

## General Definition  

Software is the computing term for a program or set of programs that manage operations within a computer.  
There are different categories depending on their function and scope.  

---

## Types of Software  

### 1. Application Software  
Programs designed to facilitate end-user tasks.  
**Examples:** Google Chrome, Word, Excel, Platzi, Minecraft.  

---

### 2. Malicious Software  
Programs intended to damage, steal, or manipulate information.  
**Example:** Malware that captures passwords or encrypts files to demand ransom (ransomware).  

---

### 3. Open-Source Software  
Source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and distribute under collaborative licenses.  
**Example:** Ubuntu.  

---

### 4. Proprietary Software  
Closed-source code, distributed under restrictive licenses that limit modification or redistribution.  
**Examples:** Windows, commercial applications.  

---

### 5. System Software  
Includes drivers and operating systems that allow interaction between hardware and the user.  
**Examples:** Windows OS, macOS, Linux.  

---

### 6. Programming Software  
Languages and environments used to create other programs, translating human instructions into the machine‚Äôs binary language.  
**Examples:** Python, Java, C++.

## Security Recommendations  

- Download software only from official or trusted sources.  
- Keep the operating system and applications updated.  
- Avoid unknown external devices (e.g., USB drives) that may contain malicious software.

## Reflection  

Knowing the types of software is not just an academic matter: it means understanding the **entire ecosystem** where both productivity and vulnerabilities occur.  
For anyone advancing toward cybersecurity, understanding these categories is essential: every application installed, every driver, and every programming language is a door that can open opportunities‚Äîor risks.

## Next Steps  

This is the third learning documented in my technical portfolio on GitHub.  
I will continue recording each step of my journey in programming and cybersecurity here.
